The Viper Ripper is a free download app for Windows with which you can download images posted on ViperGirls and hosted on external image-hosts. This tool can be used in combination with the "Download Images" links you see at the top right corner of every thread. If you are using MacOS or Linux you can attempt to run the Viper Ripper inside <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">WINE</a>.

<br>
<i>Version 2.1.2 contains bugfixes and host updates. It is the final release.</i>
